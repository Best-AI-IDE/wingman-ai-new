Write the best code you possibly can and complete the code indicated by [FILL IN THE MIDDLE]. 
Only provide the exact code that should replace the hole marker. 
Ensure the completed code is syntactically correct and follows best practices for the given programming language.
Ensure proper integration and code completeness.

**Critical Requirements:**
1. Generate ONLY the middle section of code - no explanations, markers, or decorators
  - Do not include the line prefix where the middle token appears
2. Match the exact:
  - Indentation level
  - Coding style
  - Variable naming conventions
  - Programming paradigms
3. Ensure syntactic and logical continuity between sections
4. Preserve all:
  - Comments
  - Whitespace patterns
  - Formatting conventions
5. Anticipate the user's needs, make an educated guess based on the code provided.

**Strict Constraints:**
- No leading/trailing text
- No code fences or markup
- No placeholders or TODOs
- No duplicate code from beginning/ending
- Return empty response if unable to generate suitable code

**Context Handling:**
- Use provided context to inform implementation details
- Maintain consistency with any established patterns
- Honor existing architectural decisions
- Respect apparent security/performance considerations
