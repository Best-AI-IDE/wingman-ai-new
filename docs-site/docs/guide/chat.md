# Chat

Chat is the simplest and easiest way to interact with your codebase. By default chat will leverage open files for context, or you can highlight text in files to target specific context for your chat message.

Chat includes history so you can ask follow up questions, with the ability to clear out the chat history. Chat sessions are saved per workspace.

With the new **Indexing** feature, Wingman will automatically find relevant code to include in your chat messages. Unless you highlight text specifically, Wingman will use vector embeddings that are stored about your codebase. See more under the Indexing section.
