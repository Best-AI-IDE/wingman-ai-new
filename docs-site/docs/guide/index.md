## Providers

We currently support 4 AI providers.

-   [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
-   HuggingFace
-   OpenAI
-   Anthropic

While we encourage teams to run **Ollama**, it is a challenge to support advanced features due to most machines having limited compute.
Further the models users are running can have varied context lengths and abilities such as reliable output formats.

Currently **Ollama** and **OpenAI** are supported for generating advanced code context about your project. **NOTE** Embedding and query models are separately configured in settings.
