# Model Context Protocol

[Model Context Protocol] is supported! MCP enables seamless integration between AI models and application contexts, providing a standardized interface for dynamic model interactions, configuration management, and context-aware reasoning across different platforms and development environments.

You can find examples, along with documentation on how to create your own [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples).

MCP servers run locally using a command line, or a self hosted web server.

## Adding a server

You can add either a `command` or `sse` MCP tool to Wingman, and validate the tool right in the settings screen. You'll be able to see which tools it detected for each MCP server.

When you chat with Wingman it will automatically use the latest tools that you have **saved*.
