# Indexing

Wingman includes a vector database built in that allows you to configure inclusion and exclusion filters for files to be embedded using the embedding provider of your choice. Once you configure your embeddings provider, you can choose to run a **full index** of your codebase from the Indexer view, or Wingman will index your files as your save them.

Wingman is the only code assistant that not only embeds files, but creates a comprehensive graph of your entire codebase. Allowing Wingman to leverage file to file relationships.

**Embeddings are stored locally.**
